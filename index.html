                For several years in a row, June and I would hold a
                New Year's Eve party and roast a pig in front of the
                fire place in our kitchen.  Our goal was to get a pig
                weighing about 20 to 30 pounds although one year we
                had to deal with a 50 pounder!  That truely taxed the
                system but I've sinced designed some counter weights
                which would have made the difficulties go away.
                The photo with this text by the way is in a 3/12
                column.

                June and I, with my parents and uncle and aunt in
                Caracas some time in the mid 1980s.
                The photo is 'floated' left and this text is meant to
                'flow' around it.  The 'flow' phenomenon is not well
                illustrated here because there is not enough text but
                the phenomenon is well demonstrated with regard to the
                roasting pig photo above and to the right.
